Relational Data: Manages the relationships between users and their created content (notes, projects, listings, etc.).

Private Messaging: Includes a system for creating and managing private conversations between users related to marketplace listings.

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt.js

Middleware: CORS
